# Targie

[简体中文](README_ZH.md)

> **macOS only.** Targie is a native macOS 14+ application. There is no Windows or Linux build, and none is planned.

Targie finds similar videos and images in a selected folder by combining metadata, content hashes, perceptual fingerprints, and visual features.

## Features

- Switches between Videos, Images, and All scan modes and remembers the selected mode.
- Recursively scans common video formats plus JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP, TIFF, GIF, and BMP images.
- Uses SHA-256, cached perceptual fingerprints, metadata, and reusable Vision features while isolating unreadable files.
- Keeps video and image groups separate for side-by-side review with static in-app previews.
- Opens videos in the default player and reveals either media type in Finder.
- Supports explicit multi-selection and partial-success batch deletion.
- Requires an explicit choice between moving files to Trash and permanent deletion, with a second confirmation for permanent deletion.
- Supports English and Simplified Chinese with instant switching and remembered preference.
